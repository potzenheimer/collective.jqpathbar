Introduction
============

This package replaces the Plone `portal_breadcrumbs` with a jquery.breadcrumbs.js enhanced pathbar
that auto collapses and therefore doesn't inhabit as much space as the default pathbar.

It utilizes z3c.jbot to provide a custom template that uses an unordered list for the breadcrumb trail.
